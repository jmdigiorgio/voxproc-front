    <p>We don't need statistics to tell us that doomscrolling is bad for our productivity, but it's not just the workplace that is affected. People lose hours of their free time everyday to scrolling.</p>

    <p>The problem is that tech companies are incentivized to keep us on their platforms for as long as possible. For most platforms, that means keeping your eyes on the screen. And while your eyes are on the screen, you're not doing anything else. If Mozart was alive today, would he compose his masterpieces or would he just be another person addicted to their phone? How many <em>Mozarts</em> have already been lost to the scroll?</p>

    <h3>voxproc wants to help solve this problem</h3>
    <p>Social media can be interesting and informative. Many of us have switched to these platforms for all of our news consumption because traditional media sources are so much slower and their biases are reflected in what they choose to talk about <em>and</em> what they don't talk about. No one really wants to go back to watching cable TV news.</p>

    <h3>And yet hours of scrolling and distraction doesn't feel like the solution either</h3>
    <p>So, is there a middle ground?</p>
    <p>Is there a way to stay informed by sources you trust without losing hours of your life every day to scrolling?</p>

    <h3>What if you could listen to social media like you listen to the radio?</h3>
    <p>At voxproc, we are starting with the assumption that this is possible and people want it. We have a lot of technological and business challenges ahead of us, but we are convinced that this solution is badly needed.</p>

    <h3>Join us in reimagining social media consumption</h3>
    <p>We're at the beginning of this journey. The technology to convert social media content into natural-sounding speech has reached a point where this is not just possible, but actually enjoyable. We believe this could fundamentally change how we interact with social media - from an attention-demanding visual experience to a background audio experience that fits into your life.</p>
    
    <p>Whether you're commuting, exercising, or doing household chores, voxproc lets you stay informed without being glued to a screen. It's time to break free from the scroll.</p>

    <h3>Where we are</h3>
    <p>We're currently building a minimum viable product (MVP) that will allow us to test our assumptions and validate our business model. Soon, there will be a way to sign up for alpha access/interest in voxproc. Your feedback will be crucial in defining how we all consume social media in the future. Until then, watching this space is the best way to stay up to date.</p>
