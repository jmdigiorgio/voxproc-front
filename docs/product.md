# Voxproc Problem Statement

## Product Vision

voxproc transforms how users consume social media content by converting text-based posts into an audio stream experience, enabling continuous or periodic information consumption without visual or tactile interruption of primary tasks. Think of it as "a radio station for social media" - a background audio companion for the modern professional or people who are just tired of looking at their phones all the time.

## Target Users

- Knowledge workers who need to stay informed while maintaining productivity
- Professionals who value real-time information but can't constantly check social media
- Multitaskers who want to consume content while engaged in other activities
- Social media power users looking for a more efficient way to consume content
- People who want to be connected to social media without being totally distracted by it
- People who are trying to spend less time on their phones
- People who can't see well or at all but still want to consume social media

## Core Problems We're Solving

1. **Context Switching Burden**: Traditional social media platforms require users to stop their current activities and visually focus on the platform to consume information, leading to productivity loss and workflow interruption.

2. **Information Accessibility**: While platforms like X, Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon excel at rapid information sharing, their text-based nature creates a visual dependency that limits when and how users can consume content.

3. **Attention Management**: Users currently face a trade-off between staying informed and maintaining focus on primary tasks, often leading to either missed information or reduced productivity.
